### üßë‚Äçüéì Disclaimer:
This summary on DI is based on my understanding of the DI principle (after research) and is for learning purposes. It's open for discussion and improvements. You can check out the demo source code below.

# Dependency Inversion
## üß† Definition
#### High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should not depend on abstractions.

## The üéØ of dependency inversion principle
Is to avoid this highly coupled distribution with the mediation of an abstract layer and to increase the re-usability of higher/policy layers. It promotes loosely coupled architecture, flexibility, pluggability within our code.

## ü•á Golden rule
High-level (client) modules should own the abstraction otherwise the dependency is not inverted!

## üöÄ Summary 
- **Dependency Inversion** **Principle**- Higher-level component owns the interface. Lower-level implements.
- **Dependency Injection** **Pattern** - Frequently, developers confuse IoC with DI. As mentioned previously, IoC deals with object creation being inverted, whereas DI is a pattern for supplying the dependencies since the control is inverted.
- **Inversion of Control** -  is the¬†**technique**¬†for inverting the control of object creation and¬†**not¬†the actual pattern¬†for making it happen.**
- **Dependency Inversion** promotes loosely coupled architecture, flexibility, pluggability within our code
- Without **Dependency injection**, there is no Dependency inversion

## üß∞ Demo

This demo is for future references if/when I don't feel confident enough that I understand in practice what **DI** is all about.
I think dependency inversion is best explained in simple N-layered architecture so I'll try doing just that.

 #### Altho we have some dependency injection in this setup, we are not inverting any dependencies thus not implementing the dependency inversion principle.
    
![not-inverted-dependency](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10576276/153411510-6b83e74d-1210-465c-a5f6-4f32c2e76a97.png)

As shown in the graph, the dependency is not inverted and the UI is depending on the Business layer, which depends on Data layer. 
This means that the higher-level layer depends on the implementation details of the lower-level layer. We're trying to use an interface to decouple this dependency but this is not enough. 
### So what?!
To demonstrate an issue with not inverting dependencies we could introduce a change in the Data layer. Let's say that we need to change a property name in the ```WeatherForecastDbo.cs```
    
![changed-property-name](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10576276/153416701-2c656ac5-5f45-4c31-a51d-050ddc5712d8.png)

 ### When we build the project we get the following errors.

![build-errors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10576276/153421063-b8fcbfa1-3f7f-498f-b02c-042df4531c62.png)
    
 The issue here is that this error is now reflecting an outside project in the business layer. This means, that if we need to rename a property in our database, this would affect the business logic. We could think, that after we're using an interface (abstraction) we're safe from such things, but we didn't actually invert the dependencies. 

To fix this, we need to follow the simple rule - the client (higher modules) own the interface.
    
1. ### ‚úîÔ∏è Change interface ownership. 
    The IDummyWeatherForecastRepository should be owned by the DI.WeatherApp.Services instead of the DI.WeatherApp.Data
    Also the ```IEnumerable<WeatherForecastDbo> Get(); ``` should now return ``` IEnumerable<WeatherForecast> Get(); ``` because this is all we need in the business layer.
    
    ![change-interface-ownership](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10576276/153426030-1846bd75-2470-4a4f-a34e-96066b18ff54.png)
    
2. ### ‚úîÔ∏è Invert the dependency. 
    Remove project reference to ```DI.WeatherApp.Data``` from ```DI.WeatherApp.Services``` and add a reference to ```DI.WeatherApp.Services``` in ```DI.WeatherApp.Data``` to start using the ```IDummyWeatherForecastRepository``` interface. We also need to move the ```WeatherForecastDbo``` mapping to WeatherForecast in the ```DummyWeatherForecastRepository``` because now it is responsible for returning ```WeatherForecast``` data.

3. ### ‚úîÔ∏è Register all dependencies in the UI layer.
    In our case, the UI layer is the composition route for all dependencies.

    ### ‚öñÔ∏è Without dependency injection we can not achieve dependency inversion.

### üéâ Did we invert the dependency? üéâ

To verify that dependency was indeed inverted, we will introduce a change in the Data layer like before. 
üöÄ This time the error will be contained only in the ```DI.WeatherApp.Data``` and we don't need to update higher-level modules.

### This is what the dependency flow looks like

## üéâ We can make changes to the lower level DI.WeatherApp.Data project, and this won't affect higher
